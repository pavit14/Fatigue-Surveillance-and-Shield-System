# Fatigue-Surveillance-and-Shield-System
•	Initiated a deep learning application utilizing Face Landmark Detection algorithm to identify the driver's level of fatigue state by Eye Aspect Ratio as a threshold value stored in cloud database
•	Systemized the Electric Vehicle to reduce the speed when driver is found to be fatigue using the concept of IOT working with raspberry pi

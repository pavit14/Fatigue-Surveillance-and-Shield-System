# Fatigue Surveillance and Shield System
This project aims to prevent accidents caused by driver fatigue by developing a fatigue surveillance and shield system. The project utilizes a camera to capture images of the driver and process them using computer vision techniques. The system will detect signs of fatigue in the driver, such as drooping eyelids. If the system detects signs of fatigue, an alert will be sent to the driver and the vehicle will be slowed down or stopped.

## Features
* Captures images of the driver using a camera.
* Processes the images using computer vision techniques to detect signs of fatigue.
* Sends an alert to the driver if signs of fatigue are detected.
* Slows down or stops the vehicle if the driver does not respond to the alert.

## Dependencies
* OpenCV
* NumPy
* dlib
* playsound

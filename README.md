# Fatigue Surveillance and Shield System
The Fatigue Surveillance and Shield System is a life-saving project designed to prevent accidents caused by driver fatigue. It employs computer vision techniques to detect signs of fatigue in the driver, such as drooping eyelids, and takes immediate action to ensure road safety. The system captures images of the driver using a camera, processes them in real-time, and sends alerts to the driver if fatigue is detected. Additionally, the system can automatically slow down or stop the vehicle if the driver fails to respond to the alert, thus mitigating potential risks on the road.

## Features
* Captures the real-time video of the driver using a camera installed in the vehicle.
* Processes the video using advanced computer vision techniques to detect signs of fatigue, such as drooping eyelids and drowsy facial expressions.
* Sends real-time alerts to the driver through visual and auditory cues if fatigue is detected.
* Initiates automatic actions to slow down or stop the vehicle if the driver does not respond to the alert promptly.

## Dependencies
To successfully run the Fatigue Surveillance and Shield System, the following dependencies are required:

* OpenCV: OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is utilized for image processing tasks, including face detection and facial landmark analysis.

* NumPy: NumPy is employed for numerical computations and data manipulation in the project.

* dlib: dlib is a powerful library used for machine learning tasks, including facial feature detection and facial landmark prediction.

* playsound: playsound is used for playing alert sounds to notify the driver when fatigue is detected.
